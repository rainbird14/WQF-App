# WQF App
An app for managing flooring jobs for the Waggoner Quality Flooring.

## Process Model Justification
As a team, we will be using "The Evolutionary Process Model", a model we found researching the subject on the internet. We plan on using this method because we will be able to build our project in phases and iterations, however we do not want to release multiple versions of the project, rather we will create the project in iterations and release only the final product to the client.
